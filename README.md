# Galaxy classifier Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional neural network trained on the Galaxy Zoo dataset (https://data.galaxyzoo.org/) capable of classifying galaxies based on their form factor.
Due of the asymmetry of the dataset only 3 classes are viable, given the number of the examples: Elliptical, Lenticular and Spiral.

Maybe adding some other labeled dataset will make possibile to add other classes.
